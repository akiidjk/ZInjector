# ZInjector

Simple Process injector for Windows and Linux written in Zig.

## DISCLAIMER

This is my first project in Zig, and the purpose is to learn Zig and process injection.
I don't know yet what to implement, but the first steps are to learn Zig and implement simple DLL injection. Then, I will move on to something similar for Linux, such as LD_PRELOAD hijacking or ptrace-based injection.

For linux on arch install: mingw-w64-headers,mingw-w64-gcc
For work the clangd lsp from zed i am using the compile_flags.txt file
